      Overview: </br>
Twitter(imitation).com is a social networking and microblogging service. At the heart of the operation is the tweet, which is a 140 character text message. Twitter connects you to the latest news, conversations, stories, and ideas. The best part is that you only see information that interests you. All that is required is an account and you can start following your favorite people, topics, and trends.
</p>
<p>
Several other important features include mentions, hashtags, replies, the discover and connect buttons. Mentions allow users to tweet to their hearts content and mention any other twitter user who may be relevant to the original tweet. Hashtags allow users to categorize their tweets so they can be later searched through for those users who are interested in a particular topic. Replies is a simple feature where users can reply to any tweet, which will then notify the original tweet writer. The discover button at the top of the page next to the home button will allow twitter users to find activities, relevant tweets and more to keep track of. Never miss out on a good conversation with the discover feature! The connect feature allows users to find out what is going on in their immediate space - who has recently followed or mentioned you? This allows users to keep in touch with their fellow followers.
